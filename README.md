# Dino-Game-Python-Automation
Here I have created a python automation for playing chrome dino game and reach out at a good highscore.
This Automation is just for entertainment purpose.
To understand this you need a moderate python knowledge , in this automation i have used python modules like numpy , pillow , pyautogui , time.
The basic structure of the code is I have designed a 2d object i.e rectangle and the processing will go like if the object collide with the plants(in the game)it passes the instruction to jump
and this process goes on and on until you itself terminates the program.
I hope you will enjoy playing with this type of automation.
